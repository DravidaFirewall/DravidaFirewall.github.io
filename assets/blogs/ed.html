    <h1>Enforcement Directorate or Excessive Directorate?</h1>

    <!-- Article Content -->
    <p>
        Enforcement Directorate an Enforcement Agency of the Union Government has been in the limelight in the last decade,unfortunately for wrong reasons.
    </p>
       <h2> Brief History: </h2>
       <p>
         The history of Enforcement goes back to 1956 where it worked as a unit under Department of Economic affairs of Finance Ministry .It was renamed as “Enforcement Directorate” and shifted to “Department of Revenue” in 1960.
        The organisation is mandated by the Union Government to enforce laws related to Foreign Exchange and Money Laundering such as Foreign Exchange Management Act(1999), Prevention of Money Laundering Act(2002) etc..,With an amendment in 2019 to the PMLA Act the government armed ED with draconian powers which has been criticised as legal excesses in recent times.
        </p>       
        <h2> What is Money Laundering? </h2> 
        <p>
         Money laundering is the act of Illegal process of minting large amount of money by illegal means such as Drug Trafficking,Bribes etc..,Money laundering involves three stages viz Placement,Layering and Integration.
         For example a restaurant can can inflate the Daily Cash receipts to funnel illegal cash through restaurant(Placement).The cash accumulated is parked into various Bank accounts of the Restaurant(Layering).Finally the money is used to Purchase an Asset like House,Gold etc.,(Integration). 
        But the controversy planks around the axis of the usage of powers conferred to the ED.
        </p>
        
        <h2> ECIR An Extra Legal FIR? </h2> 
        <p>
         One of the major controversy is with the procedure of arrest of a suspect.Unlike the other law enforcement agencies ED is exempted from filing a FIR. Instead Enforcement Directorate files an Enforcement Case Information Register(ECIR) which does not have the same compulsions line an FIR like production of a documented copy to the suspect during the arrest or sending the same to the magistrate under section 157 of CrPC.
        ECIR is not a statutory document and Section 48 of PMLA act exempts even from filing an ECIR for initiating investigation.
        The suspect on whom ECIR is filed and allowed by Adjudicating Authority eligible for arrest cannot invoke his/her Fundamental Right of “Protection against Testimonial Compulsion” guaranteed under Article 20(3).In Dalmia case,High Court of Hyderabad upheld the validity of ECIR and the Deprivation of right against Self incrimination.
        </p>
        <h2> Custodial Powers: </h2> 
        <p>
         In the recent case of ED arrest of Tamilnadu Minister Senthil Balaji, his wife had moved to High Court against the unlawful detention and custody by ED.The defence counsel N R Elango had questioned the authority of arrest and detention by Enforcement Directorate.He argued, “the PMLA Act of 2002 does not confer the powers of Station House Officer(SHO) on any ED official.”
        On the contrary it’s a fact that such SHO rights has been provided to Union government officials under Customs Act of 1962 and Central Goods and Services Tax of 2017 which is not provided under PMLA.
        Though the Chennai High Court accepted the argument that the ED officials are not Police officers, but validated their custodial powers since the testimony given by the suspect to ED is admissible in the court of law.The court further stated the agency should not be curtailed from its investigation on the debate of Custodial powers.The court instead of interpreting the law as in the books has taken a new direction of deciding the process of execution also.
        In the Vijay Amada lam Choudhary Vs Union of India(2022),the Supreme Court Validated the controversial Section 19 of PMLA and various provisions of PMLA act.Section 19 of the PMLA allows an ED official in the rank of Director,Deputy Director or Assistant Director to arrest a suspect.The official should send all the relevant documents to the Adjudicating Authority which will validate and provide permission for the arrest of an accused person.
        Since the Adjudicating Authority is also appointed by the Union Government itself its autonomy and independence in functioning is to be critically questioned. Once such case of the bureaucratic excess of ED is the Anil Deshmukh Case.
        </p>
        <h2> Curious Case of Anil Deshmukh: </h2> 
        <p>
        Anil Deshmukh was a Home Minister of Maharashtra then and a low-ranking police officer Sachin Waze who is one among the 10000 API’s in Maharashtra state.  Sachin Waze is accused of illegal extortion of Money from the local bar owners and an investigation by CBI is in-progress.
        ED interrupted and added the home minister as an accused and summoned him, interrogated, and arrested him without any solid proof or any paper trail or any evidence to link the state home minister to the Money laundering offence. The best they had was an allegation without a base by a low-ranking officer who withdrew the allegation in the Chandiwal Commision.
        </p>
        <h2>ED as a Political Tool: </h2> 
        <p>
        The drastic increase in number of cases in the past 5 years and the specific targeting of Opposition leaders has raised the suspicion of ED being used as a political tool.The recent petition by 18 opposition parties in the Supreme Court against the exegeses of ED reiterates the above fact which we will critically analyse in the next article.
